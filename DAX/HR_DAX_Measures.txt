-- HR Analytics DAX Measures
-- All measures used to create the current dashboard snapshot

-- 1️⃣ Total Employees
Total Employees = COUNTROWS(HRData)

-- 2️⃣ Employees Leaving / Attrition Count
Employees Leaving = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(HRData),
    HRData[Attrition] = 1
)

-- 3️⃣ Employees Staying
Employees Staying = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(HRData),
    HRData[Attrition] = 0
)
-- Checks how many employees left vs still employed.

-- 4️⃣ Distinct Departments (if you have a Department column)
Distinct Departments = DISTINCTCOUNT(HRData[Department])
-- Tells you how many unique departments are in the dataset.

-- 5️⃣ Average Age (or other numeric columns)
Average Age = AVERAGE(HRData[Age])
-- You can replace Age with Salary, Tenure, or any numeric column to see averages.

-- 6️⃣ Maximum & Minimum Values
Max Age = MAX(HRData[Age])
Min Age = MIN(HRData[Age])
-- Quickly detects outliers or data entry issues.

-- 7️⃣ Count of Missing or Blank Values
Blank Attrition Count = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(HRData),
    ISBLANK(HRData[Attrition])
)
-- Useful to see if there are any missing Attrition entries.

-- 8️⃣ Attrition Rate by Department (segmented check)
Attrition Rate by Dept = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(HRData), HRData[Attrition] = 1),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(HRData))
)
-- Put Department on rows in a table visual to see attrition rates per department.

-- 9️⃣ Quick Filter Check
Rows Currently Visible = COUNTROWS(ALLSELECTED(HRData))
